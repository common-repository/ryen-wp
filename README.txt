== Description ==
Collect 4x more responses with conversational apps using Ryen.

👉 Build beautiful conversational apps and easily embed them in your Wordpress site.
👉 Ryen helps you publish chat apps that feel native to your product and it provides the best experience for your users.
👉 With Ryen, you collect the answer as soon as the user answers the first question. You get to know exactly when the user tends to drop your form.

This plugin relies on Ryen which is a tool that allows you to create conversational forms and directly integrate them on your Wordpress site and on our Ryen JS library (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ryen/js).
